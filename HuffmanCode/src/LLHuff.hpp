		in the tree. A few notes about this one: first, the path starts at 1, and is
multiplied by 10 each iteration through to get an accurate integer representation of
the path. I wrote this function as a recursive one, and I STRONGLY recommend you do
as well. All codes for every leaf can be found in one pass of the tree with
recursion.
One final note: I made a new linked list (assigned to pq, since I was done with the
old pq, with each leaf node and its code being added to the linked list. This linked
list of characters and codes will be used to create the compressed version of the
file, in which each character is replaced with its corresponding code. This would be
a lot easier with a hash table/map, but we haven’t worked with them yet. If you want
to make a new field and create a hash table for this part, I am fine with that.
